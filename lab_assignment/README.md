NameSpace lab assignment:

Students will be instructed to declare their own namespace with a set of functions in a .h file, and define those functions in a cpp file. Then, the students will create global methods in main.cpp with the same name and alternate between using the global methods and the namespace methods.

The functions in the students' namespace and global namespace will take in an IceCream item and calculate the cost. the students' namespace function will calculate the cost by adding 10 cents to the base cost for each topping. the global namespace function will calculate the cost by adding 50 cents to the base cost if there is at least 1 topping. I referred to the global namespace function as the "global shop", and the students' namespace function as "insert student's name"'s shop. This simulates a situation in which two different shops will calculate the price of the ice cream differently. I know there may be better and more efficient ways to approach this lab, but I wanted to use namespaces because many students struggle with understanding what a namespace is and how to use it when there are functions with the same name in different namespaces.
